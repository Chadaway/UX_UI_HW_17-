<p>I am a UX/UI designer based in Atlanta, GA. I am an outloud thinker with a colorful imagination ðŸŒˆ. My goal as a designer is to bring thoughtful design catered to every user. I have a passion for connecting with my environment and genuinely care about the audience I design for. Currently, I am a intern at a fast-growing Auto Financing startup called Carputty.

    I am a graduate from the University of Central Florida with skills in design thinking, prototyping, wireframing and usability testing. With a background in healthcare, I have strengths in empathy, collaboration, and problemsolving.
    
    How did I get into UX/UI?
    
    I have always had a creative mind with a love for helping others. While healthcare gave me the opportunity to help people, I felt there was something missing. 
    
    While COVID put me out of work I started to research courses to take online as I felt my healthcare jouney had come to an end. I discovered UX design and watched a few youtube videos on the subject. Knowing that I have a knack for people and technology, I felt this was for me. 
    
    So far this decision has changed my life in many positive ways. Exploring design through emotion, functionality and pattern gives me the opportunity to impact the lives of many people. </p>
